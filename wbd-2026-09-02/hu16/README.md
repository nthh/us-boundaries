# WBD HUC16 (2026-09-02) by HUC2 region

USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset 16-digit hydrologic units (layer `WBDHU16`), from the
national File Geodatabase USGS republished on 2026-09-02, split into one spatially sorted
GeoParquet file per two-digit HUC2 region.

Coverage is partial: USGS delineates this level only where a state chose to subdivide further, so most of the country has no units here. A missing unit means it was never delineated, not that the area has none; use HUC12 for complete coverage.

  except the geodatabase `objectid`; the geometry column `shape` is renamed `geometry`.
- CRS: EPSG:4269 (NAD83 longitude, latitude), as in the source (the source declares NAD83 +
  NAVD88 height; geometries are 2D).

  21.0.0); the catalog's `manifest.json` records inputs, tools and every digest.

## Layout

Each partition is one GeoParquet 1.1 file, `hu16/huc2=<value>/data.parquet`, beside its
STAC item `hu16/huc2=<value>/huc2=<value>.json`. Rows are sorted along a Hilbert curve
(feature bbox centres, partition extent), except that features spanning a large share of the
partition (a statewide unit, say) sort last in their own row groups. Row groups hold about 2 MiB
of uncompressed data (1 MiB or 512 KiB in a few small files, so each passes Portolan's row-order
check) and at most 100,000 rows. A `bbox` struct column (`xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`, declared
as the GeoParquet covering) has Parquet min/max statistics per row group, so a reader can skip row
groups from the footer alone. Compression is zstd. `versions.json` and the catalog's
`manifest.json` list the sha256 and bytes of every file; `manifest.json` also records each
partition's row-group budget and large-feature threshold.

Partitioning by HUC2 rather than state: every unit has exactly one HUC2 (the first two digits of
`huc16`), regions nest, and a unit can touch several states (`states` is a list), so a state split
would duplicate or arbitrarily assign units.

| `huc2` | Name | Rows | Row groups | Bytes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `02` | Region 02 Mid Atlantic | 7,202 | 133 | 139,004,875 |
| `17` | Region 17 Pacific Northwest | 64 | 7 | 7,987,810 |
